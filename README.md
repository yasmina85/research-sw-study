# UCB/UC3 Software Curation Project
**Jan 2017 - Now**

## Description 

Research software is an important part of the scholarly ecosystem and open science. There are efforts underway to ensure that research software is sustainable and treated as a “first-class” research product that is regarded, assessed, and cited in a manner similar to that of a journal article However, such efforts have been hampered by a lack of knowledge about what researchers are doing with their software, how they share their software, and what they value about their software. 


**Partners/Collaborators:** UC Berkeley, California Digital Library
